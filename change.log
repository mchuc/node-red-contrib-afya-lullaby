- you can whip a thread if you send a message to him:
msg.payload = "kill" or msg.payload = "stop"
- 'step' option has been added - step, if the value between steps is to change
- the option of counting down has been added. so it's not just a lullaby, but also a function: a nice morning (i.e. slow wake-up call) = counting up
- a security option has been added for those able to otherwise;)
